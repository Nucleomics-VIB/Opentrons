## Process
1. Attach the p20 multichanel to the left mount and the p300 multichanel to the right mount and calibrate them if not yet done.
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
6. Hit "Run".
7. Transfer the plate to the thermocycler adn run the library amplification program.
8. Continue to Part-3 or store the plate for later resume.
